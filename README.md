# Image-classifier
Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. 

In this project, an image classifier built with PyTorch is developed, then converted into a command line application.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:
Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on your dataset
Use the trained classifier to predict image content
